Getting a good contact form with an AJAX submission and validation sucks. This is a vanilla contact form using basic validation and AJAX. It uses the jQuery form plugin (http://jquery.malsup.com/form) and jQuery validation (http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation).

All you have to do is set up your own settings in the scripts/mail.php file:

$mail_to = "youremail@domain.com";
$subject = "Contact Form Submission";
$from = "contact@sitename.com";
